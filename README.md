# varFEM: Variational formulation based programming for Finite Element Methods

[TOC]

This is the Ocatve version for varFEM. 

Note: (1) Run startup.m first and make sure you have installed the symbolic toolbox.

      (2) Some examples involving the PDE tool of Matlab can not be executed. 
      
      (3) Plotting problems may be encountered for examples in test folder.
      
      (4) I recommend using the Matlab version.

## Intentions

We intend to develop the "variational formulation based programming"  in a similar way of FreeFEM, a high level multiphysics finite element software. The similarity here only refers to the programming style of the main program, not to the internal architecture of the software.


Example: The stiffness matrix for the bilinear form  $\int_{T_h} \nabla u \cdot \nabla v {\rm d}\sigma$ can be computed as follows.

```
  Vh = 'P1';  quadOrder = 5;
  Coef  = 1;
  Test  = 'v.grad';
  Trial = 'u.grad';
  kk = assem2d(Th,Coef,Test,Trial,Vh,quadOrder);
```

## Variational formulation based programming

  - A variational formulation based programming is shown for 1-D, 2-D and 3-D problems. The arrangement is entirely process-oriented and thus is easy to understand. 
  
  - **As in FreeFem, fundamental functions --- int1d.m, int2d.m and int3d.m are designed to match the variational formulation of the underlying PDEs. These functions can resolve both scalar and vectorial equations (see also assem1d.m, assem2d.m and assem3d.m).**
  
  - Only Lagrange elements are provided in the current version. 
  
  - We remark that the current design can be adapted to find FEM solutions of most of the PDE problems.
